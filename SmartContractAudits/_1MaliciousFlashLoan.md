## Hello World....of malicious Smart Contracts

### Welcome to my first smart contract audit(It will be rudimentary and probably provide little value but I wanted to docuemtn my first step into this world.)

I have been reading about flash loan bots / MEV bots and was interested in the arbitrage aspect and the related potentila profitability. Much like any easy money scheme there are more opportunities for malcious intent rather than genuine money making strategy. As an infosec professional, i'm already extermely skeptical of everything so naturally, I was drawn to looking into anything claiming to make money FAST. 

I stumbled upon this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqsqbjPKTRI&t=2s) talking about a flash loan. I know the VERY bare basics of programming and solidity but I wanted to dig into this with the aid of AI.
