## What is Ethereum?

* An open source, globally decentralized, computing infastructure that executes programs called _smart contracts_. It uses blockchain to synchronize and stor the systems state changes along with a crypto currency called ether to meter and constrain execution reseources.

  - What are [smart contracts?](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)
      -  They are a program that runs on the the Ethereum blockchain. A collection of code(it's functions) and data (its state) reside at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
      -  Smart contracts are deployed to the network and run as programmed. A metaphor for them is like a vending machine. Vending machines are deployed with pre programmed logic and when the right inputs are used, a certain output is guaranteed.
      -  In the same way a vending machine removes the human vendor, the smart contract removes the need for intermediaries in many industries and examples.
      -  Characteristics of smart contracts
          - Permissionless - Anyone can write a smart contract and deploy it using the appropriate coding language(Solidity)
          - Composability - Smart contracts are public and are essentially open API's contracts can call other contracts extending capability and possibility.
