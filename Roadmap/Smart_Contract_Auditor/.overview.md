# Roadmap for Smart Contract Auditor

I've decided to start down a learning path for smart contract auditing. I will use this repo as a record of steps i've taken to achieve this.  

I will be following this [repo](https://github.com/razzorsec/AuditorsRoadmap) from razzorsec as a guide guide to becoming smart contract literate all the way up to auditing smart contracts. Additionally, I will be using the [Quillhash Smart Contract Auditor Roadmap](https://github.com/Quillhash/QuillAudit_Auditor_Roadmap) in tandem to cross reference any resources and ensure all the potential bases are covered.
